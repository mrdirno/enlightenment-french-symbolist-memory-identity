## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character discovers a 'memory trigger'—a specific combination of a smell, a color, and a sound—that unlocks a forgotten, pivotal moment from their past.
- Create a monologue from the perspective of the city of Paris, describing how it 'remembers' the people who have walked its streets and the moments they've left behind.
- Draft a letter from Léon's mother, Céleste, to Silvain, explaining her fears about the 'Luminous Index' and why she must hide it.
- Write the encounter between a 'Memory Merchant' from the Salon de la Mémoire and a client who wishes to forget a specific, painful event, detailing the transaction.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a 'Synesthetic Memory Map' interface for a specific neighborhood, where locations are tagged not with names but with sensory data (hex color codes, sound frequencies, scent descriptors) that correspond to emotional or narrative moments.
- Prototype a 'Memory Calibration' tool concept for writers: a system that prompts the user with randomized sensory pairs (e.g., 'the taste of copper' + 'the sound of distant church bells') and challenges them to write a 200-word memory scene sparked by that combination.
